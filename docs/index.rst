Welcome to DB-GPT!
==================================
| As large models are released and iterated upon, they are becoming increasingly intelligent. However, in the process of using large models, we face significant challenges in data security and privacy. We need to ensure that our sensitive data and environments remain completely controlled and avoid any data privacy leaks or security risks. Based on this, we have launched the DB-GPT project to build a complete private large model solution for all database-based scenarios. This solution supports local deployment, allowing it to be applied not only in independent private environments but also to be independently deployed and isolated according to business modules, ensuring that the ability of large models is absolutely private, secure, and controllable.

| **DB-GPT** is an experimental open-source project that uses localized GPT large models to interact with your data and environment. With this solution, you can be assured that there is no risk of data leakage, and your data is 100% private and secure.
