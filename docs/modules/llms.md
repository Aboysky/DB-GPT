In the underlying large model integration, we have designed an open interface that supports integration with various large models. At the same time, we have a very strict control and evaluation mechanism for the effectiveness of the integrated models. In terms of accuracy, the integrated models need to align with the capability of ChatGPT at a level of 85% or higher. We use higher standards to select models, hoping to save users the cumbersome testing and evaluation process in the process of use.
