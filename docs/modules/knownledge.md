# Knownledge

As the knowledge base is currently the most significant user demand scenario, we natively support the construction and processing of knowledge bases. At the same time, we also provide multiple knowledge base management strategies in this project, such as:
1. Default built-in knowledge base
2. Custom addition of knowledge bases
3. Various usage scenarios such as constructing knowledge bases through plugin capabilities and web crawling. Users only need to organize the knowledge documents, and they can use our existing capabilities to build the knowledge base required for the large model.
